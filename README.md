# Plant-identification

The Leaf Morphology-Based Plant Identifier is an image-processing application that identifies plant species based on leaf characteristics. It utilizes OpenCV for image processing and machine learning techniques to classify plants based on their leaf morphology.

# Features

Leaf Image Processing: Extracts key features from the leaf, including shape, texture, and vein structure.

Feature Extraction: Analyzes leaf characteristics such as:

Shape: Aspect ratio, circularity, convex hull, and contour features.

Texture: GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix) for texture pattern recognition.

Color: RGB and HSV color space analysis for species differentiation.

Vein Structure: Edge detection using Canny filters and skeletonization.

Machine Learning Classification: Uses algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, or CNN to classify plant species.

Real-time Identification: Allows users to capture or upload images for instant identification.

Dataset Support: Trained on a diverse dataset of leaf images for accurate recognition.
